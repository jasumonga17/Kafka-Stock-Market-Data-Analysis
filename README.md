# Kafka-Stock-Market-Data-Analysis

### Process:
•	Implemented streamlined deployment of Apache Kafka for a stock market data project, utilizing Docker to containerize the deployment process, ensuring efficient and consistent setup across environments.

•	Developed data streaming functionality in a Jupyter Notebook environment, creating a Kafka producer to serialize and transmit stock market data, and a consumer to deserialize and process the information, contributing to a robust and scalable data processing pipeline.
